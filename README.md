# repo-search-app

In the search tab, you can search for hard coded "repos" by name, description and creator.
You need to write minimum 3 characters and need to select minimum 1 search method(name/decription/creator), but there is no upper limit.
With the Reset button, the default values came back.
You can sort and order those values.
You can navigate by pagination.

To test the search, type "name" or "repo" for name search.

There are some placeholders, to show they are work well.(History page, Page 1, Page 2 and mobie view)
There is link in view, what you can see only in mobile view. 

There are some design ideas for it. By clicking on the "logo" (Repo Search App), you can change the design.
